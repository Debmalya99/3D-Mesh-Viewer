# 3D-Mesh-Viewer
###3D Mesh Viewer powered by OpenGL[3.3 CORE profile]
I did not delete the builds folder because it contains the very important assets folder, where all the models and the shader code resides.
A build for my system[Ubuntu 14.04] is included which you might not find useful, so I have included the CMakeLists.txt

### Dependancies:
* OpenGL
* GLEW
* SFML[I used 2.5.1]
* ASSIMP
* GLM[OpenGL Maths library, its commented out in CMakeLists.txt; you need to uncomment that]
